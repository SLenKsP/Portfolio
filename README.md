# Sagar Patel

I am a QA Analyst with nearly 5 years of experience providing Applications with accurate and thorough testing and analysis of manufacturing processes. Profound understanding of using samples, control points, and process variables to test a productâ€™s quality, reliability, and functionality.

Looking for some change and some more challenges at the job, I decided to learn some coding. Tried to look into some programming and scripting languages and I found myself comfirtable with Java and Javascript and decided to know more about it.
